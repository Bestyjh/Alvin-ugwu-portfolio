          <h4>Research Overview</h4>
          <p>
            This doctoral research investigates how Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is being
            implemented in elementary school classrooms across Ontario, Canada. The study examines the
            pedagogical approaches educators use, the challenges they face, and the learning outcomes
            achieved when integrating sustainability principles into K–8 curricula.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through qualitative research methods, this work aims to provide insights into effective
            strategies for embedding ESD in classroom practice, ultimately contributing to the development
            of more sustainable and environmentally conscious educational systems.
